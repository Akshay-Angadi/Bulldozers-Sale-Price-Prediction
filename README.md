# Bulldozers-Sale-Price-Prediction

## Bulldozer Sale Price Prediction - Machine Learning Project
This README will provide you with an overview of the project's objectives, dataset, problem statement, and the steps taken to predict the sale price of bulldozers using machine learning techniques. 

### Introduction
In this project, we aim to predict the sale price of bulldozers using machine learning. This problem falls under the category of regression, where our goal is to predict a numerical value based on various features. By analyzing historical data on bulldozer sales and their characteristics, we intend to build a model that accurately forecasts the sale price of future bulldozers.

### Problem Statement
The central question we're addressing is: How effectively can we predict the future sale price of a bulldozer, leveraging information about its attributes and historical data of similar bulldozer sales?

### Dataset
We'll be working with a dataset that contains information about various bulldozers and their sale prices. The dataset includes both features (attributes) of the bulldozers and their corresponding sale prices. This data will serve as the foundation for training and evaluating our machine learning model.

### Project Steps
Our project will follow these key steps:
Data Understanding: Explore the dataset to gain insights into the available features, their types, and distributions.
1. Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data by handling missing values, converting categorical variables to numerical representations, and scaling numerical features if needed.

2. Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features, create new features if applicable, and prepare the dataset for model training.
3. Model Selection: Choose appropriate regression algorithms for the task, and train multiple models using the preprocessed data.
4. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the models using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared.
5. Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune the hyperparameters of selected models to improve predictive performance.
